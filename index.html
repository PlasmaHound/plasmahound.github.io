				Have you ever noticed certain appealing features on your favorite website or app that make 
				it easier to use? For example, how easy it is to upload photos and messages on social 
				media? What about the fact that certain ads that appeal more to you play on YouTube more 
				often than ads that don't? Well, that is most likely because whatever platform it is that 
				you thought of (whether it be Facebook, YouTube, or something else) farms data from actions 
				the user has done and changes things about their platform based on what you may or may not 
				have done (like skipping certain ads and watching other ones). Log files could potentially 
				contain compromising information on users&#8212;

					anywhere from your email to your IP address (which could be used to hack into your

					goes 
					into log files. This issue explains one of the primary ethical dilemmas that programmers
					face. Do they create the program, which could be seen as a violation of personal privacy,
					or do they refuse to create the program, which can cause significant damage to their 
					career? The possibilities resulting from whether or not companies should utilise log 
					files range from a better user experience to the possibility of hackers obtaining user
					information.

				Why might creating a program that stores log files be a good thing? After a program collects data on your tendencies and habits, 
				an automated program can automatically adjust the platform that you are on to make your overall experience more positive. If you 
				browse YouTube all the time and there is a program telling it to not display certain types of ads and to display other kinds of 
				ads, this results in two things: You will be more inclined to watch YouTube ads (which results in YouTube receiving money) and you 
				will end up being more pleased because you no longer skip ads that you do not like. Both you and YouTube will be benefited in the 
				end. In addition to this, storing and analyzing log files allows the administrators of whatever platforms you use to find and correct
				bugs/program errors, which, again, benefits the users. The use of log files can be seen as useful to both consumers as well as 
				businesses, but the only way to do that is with the consent and creation by the software engineer. One of the final positive 
				contributing factors for collecting log files is to assist businesses in the marketing of their products and/or services. Using data
				from social media and the like, businesses can analyze the log files and know a lot about what the general public actually wants. 
				Rather than spending millions, even billions, of dollars on researching the public’s opinions (like many businesses have done in the
				past), they can merely analyze this data that is being collected by major companies and know massive amounts about the general 
				public. This can then be used to adjust their products and marketing techniques to better apply themselves to the public’s eye.

					Why might creating a program that stores log files be a bad thing? Data that happens to be stored anywhere can potentially be 
					obtained by a hacker. You trust companies to protect your personal information, but you can't always count on that trust. In 
					September of 2016, Yahoo announced that it had been the victim of the largest data breach in history. Over three billion users 
					were affected by this data breach (<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/data-breach/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html">The 17 biggest data breaches of the 21st century</a>). Yahoo claimed that it had 500 million 
					accounts stolen in 2014 and over an additional 1 billion accounts stolen the year before. One of the primary concerns was the 
					Yahoo was aware of the breach years before they went public with it. That means that the general population had no knowledge 
					that a third party had gained access to their personal information without warning. Any amount of information could have been 
					taken: emails, names, birth dates, telephone numbers, security questions and answers...the list goes on and on. “Security has 
					taken a back seat at Yahoo in recent years, compared to Silicon Valley competitors like Google and Facebook…critics say the 
					company was slow to adopt aggressive security measures, even after a breach of over 450,000 accounts in 2012 and series of spam 
					attacks — a mass mailing of unwanted messages — the following year.” (<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/yahoo-hack.html">Yahoo Says 1 Billion Accounts Were Hacked</a>) This is just 
					one of countless data breaches that have occurred throughout the 21st century. One of said breaches was when personal and 
					banking information of millions of Target customers was stolen, affecting 41 million people. The malware installed on Target 
					servers retrieved full names, phone numbers, email addresses, payment card numbers, credit card verification codes, and other 
					sensitive data (<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/05/23/target-pay-185m-2013-data-breach-affected-consumers/102063932/">Target to Pay $18.5M for 2013 Data Breach...</a>). In addition, social networking sites collect massive amounts of 
					data. Facebook alone collects 63 different pieces of data which are analyzed to find out what the public cares about. Facebook’s
					“like” button is clicked over 2.7 billion times every day (<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/social-big-data-the-type-of-data-collected-by-social-networks-2-2014-1">Big Data: The Type of Data Collected by Social Networks</a>). If someone 
					obtains even a minimal amount of this data, they could know massive amounts of information about millions of individual people, 
					which could be extremely dangerous for said people. Facebook is only one of many examples of possible future data breach targets.
					As long as data is stored somewhere, it can potentially be accessed by any number of people all across the world. The dangers 
					of storing log files are becoming more and more threatening to consumers in the online world we now live in.

							If I were to work in the private sector, as my own boss, I would most likely choose not to implement log files into my platform because, in my eyes, no firewall is safe enough to store the potential minefield of information that log files could contain.

						</p>
						<p class="hi">
							However, the more likely scenario would be that I would work for a company, and, if that were the case, I would not risk my career over choosing not to implement log file collection/analyzation programs that my supervisors ask me to. If I were to refuse, I could potentially be fired and “blacklisted”, in the sense that no one else will hire me based on the decision that I made. One real world example of this that is similar was when, during the Cold War, many people, even those who were innocent, were accused of being Soviet spies in the red scare. Many, including a number of liberal Democrats, others in the government, and those in Hollywood, were accused and often imprisoned. However, the most notable outcome, even after McCarthy was exposed for false accusations, many were blacklisted from their field of work for years (<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>). Computer software engineers consist of such a small community that, if I was blackballed by a company, I may not be able to get another job. That would not only affect me, but also my future family as well.

							As our society evolves, it is important that we meet the needs of the public demand. These demands however must be viewed and met while strong ethical standards are also being upheld. The issue of log files is one that holds multiple viewpoints; companies use them for marketing and advertising purposes, while consumers rely on them for ease of shopping and information gathering. These log files, unfortunately have also been proven to be a negative source in the unknown outsourcing of personal information to various companies, marketing outlets and even secondary universities. As a prospective computer programmer, I understand the need for these log files to be used in the workplace; however, if given the choice, I would prefer to keep people’s private information exactly that — PRIVATE.

                                However, the more likely scenario would be that I would work for a company, and, if that were the case, I would not risk my career over choosing not to implement log file collection/analyzation programs that my supervisors ask me to. If I were to refuse, I could potentially be fired and “blacklisted”, in the sense that no one else will hire me based on the decision that I made. One real world example of this that is similar was when, during the Cold War, many people, even those who were innocent, were accused of being Soviet spies in the red scare. Many, including a number of liberal Democrats, others in the government, and popular authors and actors, were accused and often imprisoned. However, the most notable outcome, even after Joseph McCarthy was exposed for false accusations, many were blacklisted from their field of work for years (<a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>). Computer software engineers consist of such a small community that, if I was blackballed by a company, I may not be able to get another job. That would not only affect me, but also my future family as well.
